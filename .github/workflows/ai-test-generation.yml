            This PR adds automatically generated tests to improve code coverage.
            
            ### Generated Tests
            
            The tests were generated using Qwen2.5-Coder model to target classes with low test coverage.
            
            ### Please review
            
            - [ ] The tests are well-structured and follow project conventions
            - [ ] The tests properly test the targeted functionality
            - [ ] The tests don't have any false assumptions about the code
